# Lisbon Environment Data
Scritp to retrieve data from environmental sensors of the city of Lisbon ( https://dados.cm-lisboa.pt ) and plot a graph with the results
The scritp is user interactive so you must run it and answer the questions so it know what data you want to retrieve.
I tried to comment inside the script so it would be easier to understand how it works.

There is commented old code that I left so it can be a moment of learning on how to improve python codding.
